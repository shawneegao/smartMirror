# smartMirror

**Currently looking into NYTimes API request header bug**

Made with very simple HTML+ CSS +JS + PHP stack
A simple fullscreen webpage behind a one way mirror (or in my case Ikea picture frame with a one way film squeegeed on)

#### Directly access the webpage here: http://192.168.1.4/
